    <h3>WEEK TWO</h3>
    <h4><em> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</em></h4>
     <p>The first thing I noticed when interacting with the experience was the menu bars situated at the top of the webpage.
      They helped me to use the website effectively and provided a clear indication of the information available about NGV. 
      The webpage's layout made it feel simple and easy to use. 
      The headings were presented in black bold fonts against a white background, and the use of contractions made it easy to read. 
      There were no visual distractions, and each section was easy to understand. 
      The large banners on the webpage attracted attention and highlighted major recent events.
    </P>
    <h4><em> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</em></h4>
      <p>Looked at photos in the banner (quick scan);
        Scroll down, scan what’s on the landing page;
        Scroll up;
        Click what’s on section, (spend a few seconds looked at the download options but didn’t click download button);
        Scroll down, and scan and read the content at every part;
        Quickly scroll up;
        Click hamburger menu and try to understand the main sections, pages on this website;
        Click “PLAN YOUR VISIT” button, read what information is included in it.
        </p>
    <h4><em> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</em></h4>
      <p>When I interacted with the NGV website, I spent the most time engaging with the "What's On" section. 
        This section provides information on all recent exhibitions at NGV and allows me to explore the events that interest me. 
        Detailed briefings of each event are available, which helped me plan my visit more effectively.
      </p>
    <h4><em> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</em></h4>
      <p>The actions I performed the most during my interaction were pressing the back button and scrolling up and down. 
        This was mainly because the page was quite long, and I needed to scroll down to review all of the content quickly. 
        Additionally, after browsing, I needed to go back to the previous page, and to do this, I had to click the back button. 
      </p>
    <h4><em> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</em></h4>
      <p>I found that NGV is also a kid-friendly place, and I would like to visit with my son. 
        Before going there, I want to see more details about the kids' program and any special events for kids, so that I can plan our visit well. 
        There is some information I need to know before my visit, such as trading hours, parking locations, dining options, ticket booking, etc.
      </p>
    <h4><em> 6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</em></h4>
      <p>The website was easy to navigate, and I found all my answers in the "Plan Your Visit" section. 
        It had general information such as trading hours, how to access the gallery, and parking options. 
        Clicking on "How to Get There" automatically opened the map app for directions, which was very convenient. 
        There is also a guide for those using public transport. The website is available in 8 different languages, 
        making it accessible for non-English speakers.
      </p>
    <h4><em> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</em></h4>
      <p>The NGV website is like a guidebook for all visitors, especially those who are passionate about art and exhibitions. 
        As new events and programs are always happening there, users will regularly check the website to see what's new. 
        As members, they will also receive emails every time something new is happening at the NGV, 
        which will encourage them to visit the website and have more interactions. Additionally, when people want to attend a special event, 
        they have to book their tickets through the website. This is another way to encourage people to interact with the website.
      </p>
    <h4><em> 8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</em></h4>
      <p>In my opinion, the NGV website is easy to navigate, and it provides all the information related to the gallery. 
        This makes users come back when they need help or want to check what's happening. 
        Both new and existing members can engage with the website effortlessly. Moreover, the website loads quickly and responds fast to user actions, 
        providing a good user experience.
      </p>
    
      
  
    
    <h3>WEEK THREE</h3>
    <h4><em> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</em></h4>
      <p>Digital references including: images, video, audio, 3D map, text, and social media platform.</P>
    <h4><em> 10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</em></H4>
      <p>The use of digital references such as images, videos, 3D map for visual tour, and icons on the NGV website suggests that users should engage with the website 
        and explore its content. The website uses high-quality images and videos to provide users with immersive experiences about the art and exhibitions 
        currently being held at NGV. For example, the website uses large banners with different images to highlight recent and upcoming events, 
        attracting users to click on them and explore further. The use of icons such as arrows, hamburger menu, and "book now" buttons 
        also encourages user to take specific actions, such as expanding an article, viewing all website main headers, or purchasing tickets.
        Moreover, the use of a simple design and easy-to-read typography and clear navigation menus suggests 
        that users at all ages and with different level of computer skills can use and read the website hassle free. 
        Given lots of content and interactive elements on NGV website, it is designed to be informative, 
        engaging and user need to spend lots of time to explore.

    <h4><em> 11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</em></h4>
      <p>In terms of navigating through the website, user should feel confident to explore the website and find what they are looking for. 
        In terms of exhibitions or events, users should feel engaged, informed, and excited. 
        The use of large, high-quality images and videos can create an immersive experience and give impression that these exhibitions are of high-quality,       
        high-standard, and unique. 
        For example, the use of a 3D gallery on the NGV website can help users feel more connected to the gallery and give them 
        a better understanding of the layout and location of exhibits, and what will be exhibited. 
        Similarly, the use of “hamburger” menu icons and dark clear typography on white background can help users quickly find the information they search,
        such as ticket prices, opening hours, and exhibition details.

    <h4><em> 12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</em></h4>
      <p>One of frustrating elements is when I am browsing the kids activities under NGV kids -> Explore more. 
        There’s a sub-category called “under 5s - Inspire creative thinking in these free virtual sessions for early learners.” 
        This probably would be the only exhibition/events I would attend with my toddler. 
        However, when I click it, there’s nothing shown under the page and now historical events summary. 
        This is confusing to me as I’m not sure whether such exhibition never happened or it is a new events that NGV is planning to hold. 
        If there are upcoming events, when will it be?
      </p>
    <h4><em> 13.  What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</em></h4>
      <p>The NGV Kids section offers activity sheets and games that you can download and play with your kids. 
        I find this function very engaging as the learning resources are fun and offer knowledge through play. 
        It also provides some professional background content that we can introduce to kids while they play with the material.
        Another impressive feature is the availability of 8 language options that users can use to translate the page. 
        This makes the website accessible to a wider audience, providing a better user experience.
