    <h1>Party Idea TIME</h1>
    <h2> Purpose </h2>

    <p>For people want to decorate their proposal, wedding, birthday, or anniversary, it’s quite difficult to express their ideas through text. 
      It would be much convenient if they can express their ideas through some kind of graphs to the decoration artists. 
      The purpose of this website is to address this pain point and make it a playful experience, 
      where clients can use simple shapes and colours to visualize, for example, balloon backdrop and send it along their descriptive text to the balloon artists. </p>
      
    <h2>Feature</h2>
      <p>When a user arrives on the landing page, they get an instant idea what the business is about. 
      The background color of landing page is set to be warm beige, because most of big events are supposed to be uplifted, 
      exited or cheerful. In short, the website needs to give client a warm feeling.
      
      Somewhere on this page, there will be a button called "Draw Your Idea". By clicking it, users will be directed to a page where they can start drawing shapes or colors with given 
      drawing tools on an artboard. The color of button is set in blue because this color stands out from the background and is also indicative that clients can click on it.<br>
      
      <br>On the second page,the tool panel, located on the left of the page, has four functions: shapes, options, colors, clear/save image. The Shapes section gives users three types of option: to create a rectangle, a circle and to indicate whether to fill shapes with colors or not. By click both the rectangle and fill color, users can create a rectangle with solid colors. 
      The Options section gives users ability to draw with a brush or to erase their drawing with eraser. The size of the brush can also be adjusted by using the slide bar.<br>
      
      <br>The Colors section is where users can choose colors from. I’ve provided a few default colors that are most popular for the party events. A color palette will appear if they click on the last color button.
      The "Clear Canvas" can clear all drawings in just one click. "Save as Image" button enables users to download their work as a JPG file.<br>
      
      <br>Other minor functions include text animation. You might noticed when you hover over each text along the drawing tool, the color of the text changes from grey to blue. If you click “Fill color”,
       the color of the text remain in blue, and there’s tick icon displayed in front of it. This can be interactive and visually helpful since it provides a visual aid on which functions have been enabled. These design choices aim to make the interaction user-friendly.
       The background color on this page is a retro pink, creating a happy and warm feeling while using the drawing features. <br>
       <br>I plan to work on adding an view inspiration photo function later. 
       As for the "send" feature mentioned in my presentation, it was too complicated, so I changed it to a download feature. 
       Users can save their work and send it to me through other social media. This website will make communication easier between me and my clients, allowing them to visualize 
       their requirements while enjoying the playful drawing function.
